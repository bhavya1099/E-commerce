### About

In this projects a user can visit the websites, registers and login to the website. They can check all the products available for shopping, filter and search item based on different categories like (Men's clothes, Women's clothes, Jewllery, electronics) , and then add to cart. They can add multiple item to the cart and also plus or minus the quantity in the cart. Once the cart is updated, the user can proceed to checkout and click the credit card payment details to proceed with the payment. The payment gateway is integrated using Razorpay.

The admin also plays an important role for this project as the admin is the one responsible for adding any product to the store, updating the items, removing the item from the store as well as managing the inventory. 

One of the best functionality that the projects include is mailing the customers, so once a user registers to the website, they will recieve a welcome mail for the successful registration to the website, and along with that whenever a user forgets account's password, a password reset email is send to the user which contains link to reset the password. The mailing functionality is integrated through mailgun.
